    Hello, World! It is July 26th, 2022, and this is my blog. I'm going into highschool this year so I thought a blog would be a good way to stay sane! Anyways, on to todays topic.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I've been a python developer for a little over 6 months now, and I've learned so much about programming during that time it's kind of insane. A couple days ago, I decided to learn rust, which is something I've wanted to do for a while. Anways, today I learned something. In rust, from what I can gather, there isn't an easy way to do input. This is different from python, which is literally just a function that you can store in a variable. In python, you can do <code>str(input("Prompt: "))</code> and put it in a variable. With rust, at least according to the cli app book, input can be thought of as arguments, after the command to run the program. For example, <code>let pattern = std::env::args().nth(1).expect("no pattern given");</code>. I couldn't really understand it, until I said it out loud. Basically, we create a variable called "pattern" with <code>let</code>. Then, we call <code>std</code> (standard library), <code>env</code> (environment), and then a function. <code>args()</code> is a function that gives the iterator, <code>.nth(1)</code> is the index, and I think <code>.expect</code> is just what happens if nothing is given.

    Anyways, another reason I wrote this was because I want to really understand rust as much as possible, instead of just programming in it. And hey, maybe it will be my main language, who knows!
